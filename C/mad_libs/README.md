# 🎭 Mad Libs Game (C)

A fun console-based **Mad Libs** game written in C!  
The program asks the user for random words (adjectives, nouns, verbs) and then builds a silly, creative story using those words.

---

## 💡 Concepts Used
- **String Handling** (`fgets()`, `strlen()`, removing newline characters)
- **Formatted Output** using `printf()`
- **Basic Input/Output** in C
- **Variables and Character Arrays**

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to safely take string input in C using `fgets()` instead of `scanf()`.
- How to manipulate and clean strings (like removing `\n`).
- How to structure a small story game logically.
- How to build creative programs that mix logic with fun storytelling.

## 🧱 Program Flow
1. The user is prompted to enter:
   - 3 adjectives  
   - 1 noun  
   - 1 verb  
2. The program combines these into a funny story and displays it on the screen.
