🧮 Circle and Sphere Calculator






🌟 Overview

This C program calculates:

🟢 The area of a circle

🔵 The surface area of a sphere

🟣 The volume of a sphere

based on the radius entered by the user. It’s a simple yet powerful exercise to understand how math functions and constants work in C.

🚀 Features

✅ Accepts user input for radius
✅ Calculates:
Area of Circle → π × r²
Surface Area of Sphere → 4 × π × r²
Volume of Sphere → (4/3) × π × r³

✅ Uses the pow() function from math.h
✅ Displays all values formatted neatly with two decimal points

💡 What I Learned
While creating this program, I explored and learned:

📘 math.h library — Using pow() for power calculations
🧠 Constants with const — Defining π safely
⚙️ Double precision — Handling floating-point numbers accurately
🎨 Formatting — Using printf("%.2lf") for clean decimal outputs
🔄 Multi-calculations — Deriving multiple results from one input
