⚡️ byte-by-byte
A journey of growth through code, logic, and creativity.
💬 About This Repository

byte-by-byte is my personal development log — a space where I learn, build, and experiment.
Every folder in this repository represents a new concept I’ve explored, a challenge I’ve solved, or a small victory in my coding journey.

From simple console programs to structured problem-solving and creative projects, this repo documents how I’m learning to think like a developer — one byte at a time.

🧠 What You’ll Find Inside

🧩 C / C++ — mastering logic, syntax, and precision.

☕ Java — building structure and understanding OOP principles.

🐍 Python — scripting, problem-solving, and exploration.

⚙️ C# / JavaScript — experimenting with structure and interaction.

💡 DSA — sharpening my logical and algorithmic thinking.

Each project here is written with purpose — not perfection — to show steady progress and understanding.
