📘 Description

A simple Compound Interest Calculator built in Java.
This program takes user input for the principal amount, interest rate, number of times the interest is compounded per year, and total years — then calculates and displays the final amount using the compound interest formula.

Perfect for practicing Math operations, formatted output, and user input handling.
